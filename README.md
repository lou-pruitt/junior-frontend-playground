# Frontend Internship Starter

A beginner-friendly React + Vite + TypeScript starter to practice front-end skills and ship small features.

## Prereqs
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git (optional but recommended)

## Setup
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open the dev server URL printed in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

## Scripts
- `npm run dev` – start Vite dev server with fast HMR
- `npm run build` – type-check and build for production
- `npm run preview` – preview the production build locally
- `npm run check` – TypeScript no-emit check

## Suggested first steps
1) Run `npm install` then `npm run dev` to see the starter UI.
2) Tweak text/colors in `src/App.tsx` and `src/styles.css` to get comfortable.
3) Build one tiny feature (e.g., a responsive navbar or a form) and commit it.
4) Add a README section describing what you built and a short Loom demo link.

## Project layout
- `index.html` – entry HTML file
- `src/main.tsx` – React entry, mounts the app
- `src/App.tsx` – starter UI with a simple checklist and idea randomizer
- `src/styles.css` – basic styling and layout

## What to learn next
- React: components, props, state, effect basics
- CSS: Flexbox, Grid, responsive layouts, focus states, prefers-reduced-motion
- Web basics: fetch data from an API, handle loading/error states
- Git: small commits with clear messages, open a PR even if solo

Happy building!
